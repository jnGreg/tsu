# txt_sum_up_proj

##  Project Description
A simple REST API app to summarize texts given in the form of a URL or pasted.<br>
Only wikipedia articles addressed by URL are being handled rather well at the current state of development. Feel free to experiment with other sources. We take no responsibility. <br>
Max text length is 1024 chars as of now. It works slow enough anyway, trust us.<br>
